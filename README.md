## Installation:
Steps to follow 

## Usage:
Run the file and enter a youtube or soundcloud file to into the GUI and hit the get MPÂ£ file buttion  

## The plan/ to be updated:
1) Check to see if the folder is already there , if not make one - dome
2) Prompt the user to enter URL address - done
3) open a browser =done 
4) nav to https://soundcloudtomp3.app/ =done
5) Input the requested URL in the above webpage = done
6) Download the file -done
 7)Move the file to the above folder - done 

Still need to do:
8) Play the the MP3 file 
9) Wrap the above in a nice python GUI 
10) list the Mp3s in the folder via GUI
11) make the code useable on any system.  
12) Improve as I get better at  python
